Import book cover and metadata from the Open Library (https://openlibrary.org/).

Simply navigate to a page in your graph with a book title as the page title. 

You can trigger the extension by 
1. opening Command Palette and using 'Open Library import'.
2. using the SmartBlocks command <%OPENLIBRARY%>

The extension will import the book cover and metadata, as well as a description if one is available. Each element is formatted using the attribute :: code, and names and titles are made into page references using [[ ]].

The result will be as seen in this image:
